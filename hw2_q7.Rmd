Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

Have a look at the data
```{r}
msleep
```

What are the column names?
```{r}
names(msleep)
```

This will filter the mammals that sleep >= 18 hours per day.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(sleep_total>=18) 
```

We can then use arrange() to sort everything by order and sleep total.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(sleep_total>=18) %>% 
  select(name, genus, order, sleep_total) %>% 
  arrange(order, sleep_total)
```
